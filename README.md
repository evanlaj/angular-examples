# Angular Interactive Components Examples

This project demonstrates the concepts and techniques presented in the [article](ARTICLE.md).

This repository serves as a practical implementation of the article's teachings, showcasing how to create custom form components that are fully compatible with Angular's Forms and Reactive Forms APIs.

The project demonstrates:

- **Custom Form Controls**: How to implement `ControlValueAccessor` interface
- **Form Integration**: Making custom components work with `FormGroup`, `FormControl`, and `ngModel`
- **Validation**: Adding custom validators to form components
- **State Management**: Handling `disabled`, `touched`, `invalid`, and other form states
- **Reusable Architecture**: Creating a base `BasicInput` class to reduce boilerplate code
